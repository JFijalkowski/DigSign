#Dissertation Abstract 
Digital Signage is a technology whereby content, including images, video and text, is displayed
through a digital medium, for purposes such as public information, advertising and navigation.
Spurred on by the recent plans to expand the spaces in use by the Department of Computer
Science, an efficient, cost-effective and accessible digital signage solution is sought, which also
has the potential to be deployed across the university campus. This project aims to create
a robust, expandable system to provide effective wayfinding, display useful information and
help coordinate events around campus, which is easy to install and maintain. This project
will analyse various potential technologies and methodologies for such a system, and adapt
an existing prototype system made with C++ and OpenFrameworks.
